# DoubleMesh
This plugin creates two new Maya commands - checkDuplicateFace and checkDuplicateMesh.			
checkDuplicateMesh - checks for duplicate meshes inside existing mesh.							
If found displays DagFullPath and selects the transform node associated with the duplicate meshes.
checkDuplicateFace - checks for duplicate face under a face on the mesh.						
If found displays the DagFullPath of the faces and selects the duplicate faces.
